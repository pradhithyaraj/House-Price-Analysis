# House Price Analysis

This project analyses residential property prices in Bangalore with a focus on **price per square foot**. The goal is to explore the data, detect and treat outliers using multiple statistical methods, and study the distribution and relationships between key variables.

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `house_price.csv`  
The dataset contains property price and size information used for statistical and exploratory data analysis.

---

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed
- Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection using:
  - Mean & Standard Deviation
  - Percentile Method (5th–95th)
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Z-Score Method
- Outlier treatment through trimming / capping
- Box plot comparison of each method
- Normality checks using histograms, skewness & kurtosis
- Log transformation (where needed)
- Correlation analysis with heatmap
- Scatter plots between key numerical variables
